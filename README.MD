Clustering Categorical Data Based on Distance Vectors
========================================

This is the R implementation for the algorithm proposed by [1].

Run `zoo.R` and `soybean.R` to see the performance of this algorithm.

The implementation largely depends on the original matlab implementation, which is accessible both in this repository and [this page](http://math.yorku.ca/~stevenw/SOFTWARE/).
