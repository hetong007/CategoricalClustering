function neighbor = giveneigh(point,prototype)
% purpose: generate the expended data by adding all the positions which have distance 1 to 
%          the existing points. The expended data will be used to calculate the neighorhood
%          number and the corresponding statistic to determine the significance of clusters.

% define variables:

% appendant             -- the returned appending data
% m                     -- number of column
% nn                    -- number of points in the data set
% uni_ori               -- data set without repetition
% tem                   -- temporary data
% working               -- temporary data


% firstly get the sets of attribute values and lengths of the sets
